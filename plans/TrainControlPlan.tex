\section{Train Control Protocol Procedure}

\checkProcedure{Train Control Protocol Checking}

A node which does not self-identify in PIP that it supports
the Train Control Protocol should be considered to have passed these checks.
\pipsetFootnote

Note that this commands the speed and functions of a locomotive node.
Although the commanded speed is quite low, the
tests should be run in a way that the associated physical locomotive
does not run away.

\subsection{Defined Event ID checking}

This section checks that the node supports the isTrain event
defined in section 4.1 and 6.4 of the Train Control Protocol Standard.

It does this by issuing an Identify Events to the node, and then
checking for a Producer Identified reply carrying the isTrain Event ID.

\subsection{Check set and query speeds}

\subsection{Check query controller}

\subsection{Check set and query functions}

\subsection{Check emergency stop}

\subsection{Check controller configuration command and response}

\subsection{Check memory spaces}

This section checks the memory spaces defined in section 7
of the Train Control Protocol Standard.

    Function Definition Information Standard.
